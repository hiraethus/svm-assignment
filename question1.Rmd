# Problem 1
*Suppose that the following are a set of points in two classes:*

`Class 1: (1,1) (1,2) (2,1)`

`Class 2: (0,0) (1,0) (0,1)`

*Plot them and find the optimal separating line. What are the support vectors, and what is the*
*margin?*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
library("e1071")
ABpoints <- read.table("ABpoints.tab", header=T)

model <- e1071::svm(group~., data=ABpoints, type="C-classification",
                    kernel="radial", scale = F)
```

The reason we use `scale = F` is because we want to find the scalar vector values without them having been scaled:
```{r}
support.vectors <- model$SV
knitr::kable(model$SV, format="markdown")
```

```{r}
plot(model, ABpoints)
```
